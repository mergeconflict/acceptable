/**
 * <p>An approximate histogram in constant space, based on Ben-Haim &amp; Yom-Tov,
 * "A Streaming Parallel Decision Tree Algorithm". The histogram is represented
 * as an array of contiguous bins of non-uniform width. Each bin is centered
 * on a certain point, called its "centroid," and summarizes some "count" of
 * observations. The bins are ordered in the array by their centroids; an array
 * is used rather than a linked structure for CPU cache friendliness.</p>
 *
 * <p>When the histogram is updated with a new observation, a new bin is created
 * for it, and then the pair of bins with the closest centroids are merged.
 * Since bins are stored in contiguous memory, this update process requires bins
 * to be shifted in worst-case linear time. The novel contribution of this
 * implementation is to maintain an insertion gap adjacent to the most
 * recently merged bin, such that for "well behaved" input (such as a normal
 * distribution), the number of shift operations required by an update should be
 * much less than the total number of bins on average.</p>
